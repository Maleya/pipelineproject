# pipelinetracker

Here we need to describe and document our code a bit, as well as a manual and walk through how to run bags manually (rosbag play etc)


## Installation and usage

### Installation

The pipetracker package can installed directly from git. Clone it into your desired package folder. 

Don't forget to `chmod + x` the scripts. 

### Usage

To get started right away with sensible defaults:

```sh
black {source_file_or_directory}
```

You can run _Black_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:

```sh
python -m black {source_file_or_directory}
```
